final keyword is not access modifier
    - we can use with veriable - method - class
    **final veriable**
    to creat constant veriable
    if the instance veriable is final
    - we initialize in same  statements
    - we initialize in constructor
    - we initialize in init block

    **finalMethod**
    prevent method overriding

    **finalClass**
    prevent inheritance
    for immutable consept; being final class is needed. for example String class

    **final keyword with Array and ArrayList**
    Veriables referance can not be changed.
