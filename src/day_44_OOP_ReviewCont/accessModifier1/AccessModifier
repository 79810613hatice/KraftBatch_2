There are four access modifier in java
    - public
    - default
    - protected
    - private

    * Veriable-Constructor-Method

    **public**
    The access level is everywhere
    What does it mean everywhere?
        -current class - outside the current class within package outsize package

    **default**
    The access level is only within package
    if we do not type any access modifier, it will be default

    **protected**
    if there is not any relation beteen classes, protected access modifier is like default
    But there is parent child  reation between classes,
    child class can reach parent class, even it if is outside the package(for data member and methods)

    **private**
    The access level is only withing the class.
    it can not reach from outside the class.

    **private constructor role**
    you can not creat the instance out of class

    **method overloading**
    not be more restrective  overriding method in child class

    **local veriable**
    dont have access modifier.
